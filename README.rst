storyline
=========

Storyline aspires to be a simple, humanist tool for authoring and playing branching interactive fictions. The goal is to combine existing tools into a powerful IF engine.

- Python: a literate programming language, Python is easy to read and easy to write. Storyline is built to be extendable.
- Markdown: Rather than invent a completely new text format, we piggy-back off of Markdown, everyone's favorite text markup format.
- Jinja2: Rather than invent yet another new IF programming language, we use the Jinja2 templating language, which provides a proven and elegant way to combine logic and textual output.

It's still early on, so please do pardon the mess.
